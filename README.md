# Keyslogger - Keylogging Proof of Concept for Security Research

Keyslogger is a proof of concept developed to demonstrate secure keylogging techniques using Python. This project highlights skills in encryption, GUI development, and real-time data processing. The tool logs keystrokes and stores them in an encrypted format, providing a controlled way to explore keylogging as a security research tool.

**⚠️ Disclaimer**: This tool is intended solely for **educational and research purposes**. It should not be used in any unauthorized environment. All testing was conducted in a secure and ethical context.

## Project Highlights

- **Encrypted Data Storage**: Each keystroke is encrypted with the `cryptography` library (Fernet encryption) before being logged, demonstrating secure data handling practices.
- **GUI for Real-Time Monitoring**: A user interface built with `tkinter` enables real-time monitoring of keystrokes in both encrypted and human-readable formats.
- **Controlled Keylogging**: Provides start/stop functionality for controlled testing within a designated environment.
- **Secure Logging for Security Research**: This project showcases an ethical approach to keylogging, suitable for security assessments or educational purposes, not for misuse.

## Technical Skills Demonstrated

- **Encryption and Security**: Utilizes symmetric encryption to securely store sensitive data.
- **Python GUI Development**: Designed a responsive GUI with `tkinter` for real-time feedback.
- **Data Handling**: Demonstrates logging, encryption, and transformation of real-time keystroke data.
- **Ethical Programming**: Highlights the importance of ethical considerations in developing potentially sensitive tools.

## Project Setup

### Requirements

- **Python 3.6+**
- **Libraries**: `pynput`, `cryptography`, `tkinter`

Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install pynput cryptography
```

### Running the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/keyslogger.git
   cd keyslogger
   ```

2. **Run the Keylogger**:
   ```bash
   python keyslogger.py
   ```

3. **Usage**:
   - Click **"Start Keylogger"** to begin logging keystrokes.
   - View encrypted keystrokes in real-time and convert them to a readable format with the GUI controls.
   - **Stop Keylogger** when testing is complete.

## Key Components

- **Encryption Setup**: Generates and stores an encryption key (`key.key`) for securing data.
- **Real-Time Key Logging**: Captures and encrypts keystrokes with minimal latency.
- **User Interface**: Displays encrypted and converted (readable) keystrokes within a user-friendly `tkinter` GUI.
- **Data Conversion**: Converts special keys (e.g., space, enter) to human-readable format for usability testing.

## Ethical Considerations

- **Responsible Usage**: This project was developed with an emphasis on ethical practices. It should only be used in controlled environments with proper authorization.
- **Educational Intent**: This project demonstrates secure and ethical programming practices for security research and educational purposes.
- **Explicit Permission Required**: Use of this tool without explicit permission is illegal and unethical. All testing should be conducted in a private environment under proper authorization.

## Project Goals

This project was designed as a learning exercise to showcase:
1. **Secure Data Collection**: Demonstrating encryption techniques to ensure sensitive data is stored safely.
2. **Understanding User Input Logging**: Developing insights into keylogging methods within an ethical framework.
3. **User Interface Design**: Building a responsive interface that enhances user experience and control over data logging activities.
